<p>About Death of a Salesman<br>
    Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman addresses loss of identity and<br>
     a man's inability to accept change within himself and society. The play is a montage of memories,<br>
      dreams, confrontations, and arguments, all of which make up the last 24 hours of Willy Loman's life.<br>
       The play concludes with Willy's suicide and subsequent funeral.</p>
<pre style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
    
    Miller uses the Loman family — Willy, Linda, Biff, and Happy — to construct a self-perpetuating
     cycle of denial, contradiction, and order versus disorder. Willy had an affair over 15 years
      earlier than the real time within the play, and Miller focuses on the affair and its aftermath
       to reveal how individuals can be defined by a single event and their subsequent attempts to
        disguise or eradicate the event. For example, prior to discovering the affair, Willy's son 
        Biff adored Willy, believed all Willy's stories, and even subscribed to Willy's philosophy 
        that anything is possible as long as a person is "well-liked." The realization that Willy is 
        unfaithful to Linda forces Biff to reevaluate Willy and Willy's perception of the world. Biff 
        realizes that Willy has created a false image of himself for his family, society, and even for himself.

    <p style="color: blue;" >About Death of a Salesman<br>
        Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman addresses loss of identity and<br>
        a man's inability to accept change within himself and society. The play is a montage of memories,<br>
        dreams, confrontations, and arguments, all of which make up the last 24 hours of Willy Loman's life.<br>
        The play concludes with Willy's suicide and subsequent funeral.</p>
        <p style="font-family: courier;">Willy wants Biff's affection and adoration as before, but instead 
            the two constantly argue. Willy vacillates, sometimes criticizing Biff's laziness and ineptitude, 
            other times praising his physical abilities and ambition.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 50px;">Willy is not an invincible father or a loyal husband or a fantastically<br>
             successful salesman like he 
            wants everyone to believe. He is self-centered.</p>
